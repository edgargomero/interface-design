## Acknowledgments

The **kntor-design-atomic** plugin is based on [**interface-design**](https://github.com/Dammyjay93/interface-design) by [Damola Akinleye](https://github.com/Dammyjay93). The original project provides an excellent foundation for building interfaces with craft, memory, and consistency inside Claude Code. The Atomic Design adaptation adds structural methodology (Brad Frost) to that craft.
